/sign is silly. Turn that into /expose and require another's tripcode to be entered, then show it only to them. (Take out cooldown)

/modhelp
/adminhelp should only work for mod/admin

clean up by getting rid of /tsign and maybe a couple others.


Images? Send a tripcode message first.

"Tripcode will appear as" add \n

Timeout for tripcode changes. Maybe they can only change once a week or whatever? Admin can remove that cooldown.

Ban by default. Add username to whitelist

Better error detection in tripcode section.

Take away Create Poll?

Possible feature: Allow admin to set a flag that lets users send an anonymous message (without tcode)

Make Installer script to walk people through it (get them to paste in the API code, copy the files for them, etc.)

Security:
- Is it a problem to sudo?
- The salt needs to be stored per-user
